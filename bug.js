This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific camera configurations.  The issue manifests as an inability to capture images or videos, resulting in a blank or corrupted output. This frequently occurs when using custom camera settings like flash mode or focus mode, or on certain devices. The error is not always accompanied by a clear console error message, making debugging challenging.
