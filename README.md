# Expo Camera Capture Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with certain configurations.  The issue results in the failure to capture images or videos, leading to blank or corrupted outputs.  The code examples show the problematic setup and a potential workaround.

## Problem
The core problem lies in the inconsistent behavior of the Expo Camera API across different devices and configurations. Certain combinations of flash mode, focus mode, or even device-specific hardware limitations can trigger this issue.

## Solution
The proposed solution focuses on robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. It involves checking the captured data for validity before processing it. If the data is deemed invalid (e.g., empty or corrupted), a fallback mechanism is triggered, which might involve displaying an error message to the user or attempting to capture the image again with different settings.
